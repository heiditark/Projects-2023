1. I've added the class structu without any methods to my project. I'm having problems with scalafx which has limited the progression.
I'm planning on going to a lab session on Thursday to get this fixed. In the meanwhile when I haven't been able to progress the project
I've been doing research from the references that the assistan suggested me. I'm late on from my schedule but I'm planning on making a new one
since I know better now than a couple of week back on what I really need to invest my time on. All in all I've used 5 hrs on the project.

EDIT: I had to make a new project since I couldn't get the sbt working. I'll delete the other one once I've copied the classes to this project.

2. So far I've done all the graphs except pie diagram which I'm going to start doing in few days. I still need figure out few things in line diagram
such as drawing the axis and adding the grid. After that I'm going to focus on how the user is able to edit the graphs from the interface.
 When that is done I have only thing I've left is adding and reading a file containing the data points through the Interface.
 I've used 25 hours on the project.
